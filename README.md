## Introduction

This notebook has been prepared to document the development and completion of the tasks assigned in the Principles of Data Analytics module.  
It follows the structure outlined in the assignment sheet and addresses each task in the order provided. 

## Purpose

Combining the course materiel, the tasks proposed in the module and personal research, this notebook aims to demonstrate my ability in terms of :

- Setting up the learning and practice environment.
- Sourcing and investigating the data using the Iris dataset.
- Exploring and visualizing data using the Iris dataset.
- Problem solving and decision making.
- Research skills development. 


## Tasks overview

*   Task 1: Source the Data Set   
    Import and Load dataset.  
*   Task 2: Explore the Data Structure   
    Dataset description.  
* Task 3: Summarize the Data  
    Calculate : mean minimum maximum standard deviation median.  
* Task 4: Visualize Features 
    Plot histograms using matplotlib.  
*   Task 5: Investigate Relationships   
    Scatter plot od 2 features from dataset.  
    Color-code of the three different classes of the scatter plot points.   
*   Task 6: Analyze Relationship  
    Use of numpy.polyfit to add a regression line to the scatter plot from Task 5.  
*   Task 7: Analyze Class Distributions  
    Create box-plots of the petal lengths for each of the three classes.    
*   Task 8: Compute Correlations    
    Calculate the correlation coefficients between the features.  
    Display the results as a heatmap using matplotlib.   
*   Task 9: Fit a Simple Linear regression  
    For the two features in Task 5, calculate the coefficient of determination R2.  
    Re-create the plot from Task 6 and annotate it with the R2 value.   
*   Task 10: Too Many Features  
    Use seaborn to create a pairplot of the data set.  
    Explain, in your own words, what the pairplot depicts.

## Environment Setup :
| Python in Git     |
|----------|

- Navigate to [github](https://github.com/)
- Click Sign up.
- Follow the prompts to create your personal account.  
***  
- Go to github.
- Log in to your account.
- Click the new repository button in the top-right **'+'** symbol
- Follow [steps](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository)
- Click create repository.  
***
- On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
- Under the repository name, select the code dropdown menu.
- Click Create codespace on main.
<br /> 
- From menu top left click on View > Explorer  
- Under repository title ( in bold) click on New file  
- Lower case file name, then add .ipynb extension  
- Follows steps from coding to committing then lastly syncing changes.

| Python on Windows     |
|----------|

[Download cmder](https://cmder.app/)  
[Download notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)  
[Download anaconda (python)](https://www.anaconda.com/download)   
[Download vs code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)


    
-   Open VS Code and select "File > New File",  
    Save the file as .py format (e.g., my_script.py).   
    Write a Python script in the file.  

-   With Python file open in VS Code, launch the terminal (see vscode menu)   
    Navigate through the terminal until reaching the same directory where Python file is located.  
    Possible to use Cmder for running Python code for '.py' files. Same as in Vs code, navigate to the directory where the Python file is saved using the cd command.  

-   Cmder is mainly for command-line usage, while VS Code is where would most of coding and debugging run.   
    
-   Lastly, steps to [clone repository using command line](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)   
    Clone allows to copy the repository from GitHub to the local machine   
    Changes can be pushed to the remote repository on GitHub and/or pulled from Github into the local machine.
